My privacy policy is simple: **I do not collect or store any of your data and I don't track your usage in any way.**

<br>

However, I do embed iframe video players from YouTube on my blog posts and YouTube does load and use things such as cookies in their players that may compromise your privacy. For more information on that you'll have to look at YouTube's **[privacy policy](https://www.youtube.com/static?gl=GB&template=terms)**. I will try my best to use the alternative no-cookie links but I cannot guarantee it, therefore I request for you to stay away from the blog portion (/blog or /blogs) of my site if you do not wish to have these third-party cookies on your machine.

This privacy policy is subject to change. When change does take place the date below "Privacy Policy" ("As of {date}") will update to the date the change occurred.
