My privacy policy is simple: **I don't track your usage, I do not collect or store any of your data EXCEPT IP addresses.**

<br>

IP addresses are required to be logged in order for my web server ([NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/nginx/)) to communicate with your web browser effectively. Along with IPs Nginx may also log user-agent strings, browser types, operating systems, referral URLs, device information (e.g., device IDs), device settings, endpoints visited and search terms. These are all required for my entire web stack to function so if you dislike please don't use any of my services under this domain (including api.devgoldy.xyz and cdn.devgoldy.xyz). IP address are automatically deleted after 15 days.

<br>

Additionally, I do embed iframe video players from YouTube on my blog posts and YouTube does load cookies for their video players that may compromise your privacy. This is out of my control, for more information you'll have to visit YouTube's **[privacy policy](https://www.youtube.com/static?gl=GB&template=terms)**. However I will try my best to use the alternative no-cookie links but I cannot guarantee it, therefore I request for you to stay away from the blog portion (/blog or /blogs) of my site if you do not wish to have these third-party cookies on your machine.

This privacy policy is subject to change. When change does take place the date below "Privacy Policy" ("As of {date}") will update to the date the change occurred.
